JUNE-NZ
=============

This is the implementation of the differentiable ABM at ESR, this is part of the ``JUNE-NZ`` public health modelling framework at ESR. 

_Agent Based Models (ABMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for investigating complex social interactions, particularly in the context of public health and infectious disease investigation. In this project, we developed a tensorized and differentiable agent-based model that seamlessly integrates into the Pytorch machine learning framework (known as JUNE-NZ). This integration allows us to harness the power of modern GPU units and enable the real-time and fully automatic parameter calibration by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of neural network through backpropagation._

_The model was employed to investigate the 2019 measles outbreak occurred in New Zealand, and a good skill is shown for simulating the outbreakâ€™s peak accurately. Moreover, we extensively explored various policy interventions within the model and thoroughly examined their potential impacts._

The model setup is described below:
